# KlipperScreenVNC
A VNC Client for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3.  The VNC Client is used to control KlipperScreen Remotely


Please copy the Touchlib and ArduinoVNC folders to your My Doucumnets\Arduino\libraries  folder.
Install the GFX_Library_for_Arduino into Arduino IDE

If you are already using klipperScreen on your Printer, I have attached a launch-KlipperScreen.sh file which you place in the Klipperscreen/scripts folder.  This will allow you to run 2 instances.

Install XtigerVNC  sudo apt install xtigervnc

Modify your parameters SSID/Password and Printer IP.

Upload sketch and restart KlipperScreen.

Optionally I have attached the STL for the case I use.  Below are the parts I used
